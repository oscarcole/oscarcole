### Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹


I am just now starting to upload things into GitHub, most of my work had been proprietary and I could not release them as public repos. I have since taken all my private repos down and am starting fresh.

#### Technologies
- Currently only working with Python, Pytest, and Selenium as I am looking to enter the field of test automation
- I am debating on starting a blog on https://dev.to/ to somewhat keep me accountable to building projects.
